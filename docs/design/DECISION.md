# Decision: Autonomous Roundtable Orchestrator Architecture

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Status:** Closed
**Evidence:** `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` — six questions, three agents (Codex ×3,
Gemini ×3, IC ×3), four rounds

---

## Summary

Build a roundtable orchestrator **on top of Jido 2.0** in Elixir, packaged as
a Nix flake app. Active per-question discussion lives in GitHub Issues;
durable artifacts (BRIEF, DECISION, transcripts) stay in git. Agents are
invoked as CLI subprocesses; the orchestrator owns all GitHub side effects.

## Decisions

### Foundation — Jido 2.0

Use `{:jido, "~> 2.0"}` as the runtime foundation. Do not roll a custom
`GenServer` + `System.cmd/3` inline loop.

- Each CLI agent invocation is a `Jido.Action` (`RunCliAgent`).
- State transitions (`continue → satisfied → closed`) are the orchestrator
  agent's `cmd/2` function — pure, unit-testable without running any LLMs or
  hitting GitHub.
- Side effects (`gh issue comment`, `gh issue edit`, `gh issue close`) are
  `Directive`s executed by the Jido runtime, not inline in action logic.
- `Jido.Signal`s carry events between the orchestrator and any future
  sub-agents or watchers.
- OTP supervision and fault tolerance are inherited from Jido's runtime — no
  custom supervisor tree needed for v1.

**Defer `jido_ai` to v2.** IC triage in v1 uses a raw `claude -p` CLI call
via `RunCliAgent`, same as participant invocations. `jido_ai` becomes relevant
if an Elixir-native selector, summarizer, or fallback judge is needed later.

### Shared State — Hybrid

| Content | Medium | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Active per-question turns | GitHub Issues | Atomic writes, no merge conflicts, parallel-agent safe |
| Question satisfaction state | Issue labels | Machine-readable without prose parsing |
| Question lifecycle | Issue open/closed | Natural termination signal |
| BRIEF, DECISION, ATTRIBUTION | Git-tracked files | Durable, reviewable, version-controlled |
| Session index (Q# → issue#) | `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` in git | Stable pointer; not written during live rounds |
| Transcripts/archives | Git-tracked files | Persist after issues close |

Do not write agent positions to `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` during live rounds.
That file is updated by the orchestrator only when opening or closing a
discussion, not turn-by-turn.

### Turn Protocol — Round-Robin + IC Close

- Fixed agent order within a question: `[codex, gemini, claude_ic]`.
  `claude_ic` runs last as the IC; it synthesises, issues the next prompt,
  and decides whether to continue or close.
- Questions can run in parallel across GitHub Issues using
  `Task.async_stream/3` (or Jido's equivalent `await_all`). Questions with
  declared dependencies must be sequenced; independent questions are parallel.
- One round = all agents have commented once on a given question.

### Termination — Labels Primary, IC Triage Fallback

1. After each agent posts, the orchestrator reads
   `gh issue view <n> --json labels,state,comments`.
2. If all active agents have a `satisfied` or `satisfied-conditional` label
   and none have `needs-more-evidence`, the issue is closed.
3. If an agent's response contains no detectable satisfaction marker, the
   orchestrator invokes `claude_ic` with a triage prompt: *"Does the latest
   comment on this question indicate satisfaction? Reply: satisfied /
   satisfied-conditional / needs-more-evidence."* The IC response sets the label.
4. `max_rounds` (default 5) reached without consensus → orchestrator posts a
   summary comment, adds a `needs-human-review` label, leaves the issue open,
   and exits.

### CLI Agent Invocation

The orchestrator, not the agent, handles all GitHub mutations. Agents only
produce prose.

```
# Prompt construction
prompt = Roundtable.Prompt.build(brief_path, issue_json, agent_role)

# Invocation (per-agent headless flags confirmed against installed versions)
claude 2.1.83:    claude -p --output-format json  <<< prompt
codex 0.116.0:    printf prompt | codex exec - --json --output-last-message /tmp/out
gemini 0.35.0:    gemini -p prompt --output-format json

# Posting (orchestrator side effect)
gh issue comment <n> --body-file <rendered_response>
gh issue edit    <n> --add-label satisfied --remove-label needs-more-evidence
gh issue close   <n>
```

**Q1 caveat (Codex):** headless flags and auth preconditions confirmed
locally. One live end-to-end scripted run per agent is still needed to
characterise output truncation/edge cases before hardening the parser.
This is a production-hardening item, not a blocker for the v1 scaffold.

### Implementation Form — Elixir/Mix + Nix Flake

- `mix new roundtable --sup` with `{:jido, "~> 2.0"}` in `mix.exs`.
- Entry point: `mix run -e 'Roundtable.CLI.main(["docs/design/BRIEF.md"])'`
- Nix flake provides a `devShell` with Elixir + Erlang + `gh` + the three
  CLI agents. A `packages.default` app output wraps `mix run` as `roundtable`.
- No Docker, no external database, no message broker.

## What Needs Building (Domain Pieces)

Jido provides the runtime. These modules are project-specific:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Roundtable.Actions.RunCliAgent` | `System.cmd/3` wrapper for claude/codex/gemini |
| `Roundtable.Actions.Gh.*` | `gh issue view/comment/edit/close` wrappers |
| `Roundtable.Prompt` | Assemble BRIEF.md + issue JSON + agent role → prompt string |
| `Roundtable.Satisfaction` | Parse/apply label policy from agent response |
| `Roundtable.Scheduler` | Round-robin agent order, dependency-aware question sequencing |
| `Roundtable.CLI` | Entry point: parse BRIEF, create/load issues, run rounds |

---

## What Is Deferred

- `jido_ai` integration — defer to v2; IC triage uses raw `claude -p` in v1
- Filesystem-only offline fallback mode — defer; GitHub Issues is the primary path
- Parallel question execution — implement after sequential single-question
  proof-of-concept works end-to-end
- Automated issue creation from BRIEF.md — v1 may create issues manually;
  automate in v2

---

## Starting Point

```
mix new roundtable --sup
cd roundtable
# Add to mix.exs deps: {:jido, "~> 2.0"}
mix deps.get
# Implement in order:
# 1. Roundtable.Actions.Gh       — gh CLI wrappers (unit-testable with mock)
# 2. Roundtable.Actions.RunCliAgent — CLI agent invocation
# 3. Roundtable.Satisfaction     — label policy
# 4. Roundtable.Prompt           — prompt assembly
# 5. Roundtable.Orchestrator     — Jido.Agent with cmd/2 loop
# 6. Roundtable.CLI              — entry point
# 7. flake.nix                   — devShell + app wrapper
```

Build `Gh` actions first — they are the most testable (mock `System.cmd/3`)
and the most likely source of environment-specific surprises (auth, rate limits,
field names in `gh --json` output).
