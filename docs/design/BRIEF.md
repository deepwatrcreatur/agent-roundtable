# Design Brief: Autonomous Agent Roundtable Orchestrator

**Status:** OPEN — awaiting agent positions before implementation
**Owner:** Calder (human)
**IC:** Claude (this session)
**Participants:** Codex, Gemini-CLI

---

## Context

We have a proven multi-agent discussion format (the blackboard model from
`nix-agent-guides/guides/agentic-orchestration/`) and a satisfaction protocol
(`[satisfied]` / `[satisfied-conditional]` / `[needs more evidence]` markers
per question). The format has produced better decisions than single-agent
analysis in several design discussions.

The bottleneck is human: a person must copy each agent's output, paste it into
the shared file, then copy the next prompt and trigger the next agent. We want
to remove that bottleneck entirely.

This repo is the design and implementation home for a thin orchestrator that
drives the discussion format autonomously.

## Prior Art Survey

Before proposing designs, agents should understand what exists:

- **[claude_code_bridge](https://github.com/bfly123/claude_code_bridge)** — tmux-based
  daemon. Agents run side by side in split panes; point-to-point and broadcast
  dispatch. Designed for real-time collaborative coding, not structured deliberation.
- **[Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow)** — JSON
  workflow definitions, event-driven beat model, message bus. Team workers execute
  tasks in phases. Coding workflow tool.
- **[AutoGen SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev//user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/selector-group-chat.html)** —
  Python framework. Agents are API-callable LLM wrappers; a selector model picks
  the next speaker; termination conditions are explicit Python predicates.
- **[Multi-Agent Debate (MAD)](https://github.com/Skytliang/Multi-Agents-Debate)** —
  structured debate rounds. "Tit for tat" correction; early termination on
  consensus. Academic tool for factuality; works via API.
- **[DebateLLM](https://github.com/instadeepai/DebateLLM)** — benchmarking multi-agent
  debate; termination on agreement convergence check after each round.

### Later discoveries (added after initial agent round)

- **[Squad](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad)** — repo-native multi-agent
  system built on GitHub Copilot. Agents (frontend, backend, tester, lead) live
  in the repo as files. A `decisions.md` file acts as an asynchronous bulletin
  board — agents write decisions after completing work, others read before
  starting. Thin coordinator routes tasks; each agent gets full repository
  context. Key observation: Squad deliberately chose committed markdown files
  over GitHub Issues as the shared state medium and has production experience
  with this choice. Understand why before finalising Q5.

- **[MassGen](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen)** — terminal multi-agent
  scaling system. Multiple frontier models (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Grok) work in
  parallel; each sees other agents' latest answers; agents vote for an existing
  answer or produce a new one; coordination continues until all agents vote.
  This is the closest existing implementation of our satisfaction protocol —
  voting-to-consensus rather than satisfaction markers, but the termination
  model is the same. Python; in-memory; no GitHub integration.

- **[Jido 2.0](https://github.com/agentjido/jido)** — production Elixir agent
  framework by Mike Hostetler (`@mikehostetler`). Built on OTP/GenServer.
  Core primitives: `Actions` (reusable units of work, pure functions),
  `Signals` (CloudEvents-based messaging between agents), `Directives` (typed
  effect descriptors the runtime executes — side effects are never inline),
  `cmd/2` (single entry point: actions in, updated agent + directives out).
  Ships a DAG-based workflow planner, 25+ pre-built tools, MCP support,
  OpenTelemetry observability, and an opt-in `jido_ai` package for LLM
  integration with ReAct/CoT/ToT reasoning strategies.
  **This directly covers what agents proposed building from scratch.** Before
  designing a custom GenServer orchestrator, agents must assess whether Jido
  Actions + Signals + Directives is the right foundation. Available on
  Hex.pm as `jido`; docs at hexdocs.pm/jido.

## Constraints

The orchestrator must:

1. Work with the CLI tools already installed: `claude` (Claude Code), `codex`
   (OpenAI Codex CLI), `gemini` (Google Gemini CLI).
2. Use the filesystem as shared state — the blackboard model. No message broker,
   no database, no persistent daemon required.
3. Be simple enough to run with `./roundtable.sh <brief.md>` or equivalent.
4. Detect the satisfaction protocol markers in the discussion file to know when
   to continue vs. close a round.
5. Not require a human between rounds.

Nice-to-have:
- Pluggable agent list (add/remove agents without rewriting orchestrator logic)
- Works as a GitHub Action (trigger on push to `BRIEF.md`, outputs DECISION.md)

## Owner Preference: Elixir / BEAM

The project owner (Calder) has a stated preference for Elixir and the BEAM
ecosystem over Python and TypeScript as the implementation platform, all else
being equal. Agents should consider this seriously — not treat it as a soft
hint to politely acknowledge and then ignore.

Reasons this preference is technically relevant to the problem:

- **Process model**: BEAM processes map naturally onto agents — each agent
  invocation can be a supervised `Task` or `GenServer`. Supervisor trees
  provide fault tolerance if an agent subprocess crashes or times out.
- **Concurrency**: multiple agents could respond in parallel (`Task.async_stream`)
  rather than sequentially, without added complexity.
- **Message passing**: OTP's built-in message passing is a natural fit for
  the blackboard model's "whose turn is it" signalling.
- **Port / System.cmd**: Elixir's `System.cmd/3` and `Port` module handle
  subprocess invocation of CLI tools cleanly.
- **Mix + Nix**: an Elixir Mix project packages straightforwardly as a Nix
  flake with `beam.packages.erlang.elixir` in the devShell.

Agents should weigh these properties honestly against the alternatives. If
Python, shell, or another platform is clearly superior for the specific
constraints of this problem, say so with evidence. The goal is the best
automated discussion system, not validation of the owner's preference.

## Design Questions

### Q1 — CLI Agent Invocation (blocking)

Each of `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` has a different CLI interface for
non-interactive / headless use. Specifically:

- What flag or mode makes each agent read a prompt from stdin or a file and
  write its response to stdout without interactive prompting?
- What is the best way to inject the current discussion file as context — via
  stdin, as a file argument, or via a system-prompt flag?
- Are there token limit / output truncation concerns that differ by agent?
- Does any agent require authentication setup that affects headless invocation?

Research the actual CLI interface for each agent and propose a unified
invocation pattern (or document the per-agent differences).

### Q2 — Turn Protocol and Orchestrator Architecture (blocking)

Once we can invoke agents headlessly, we need to decide how the orchestrator
sequences them:

- **Option A — Round-robin with IC close:** Agents run in fixed order (e.g.
  Codex → Gemini → IC). IC reads after each full round, decides whether to
  continue or close. Simple, predictable.
- **Option B — File-signal directed:** Each agent's response ends with a
  `next_speaker: <agent>` field. The orchestrator reads this and routes to the
  named agent. Agents control the sequence. More flexible; also more fragile.
- **Option C — Selector agent:** A thin "selector" agent (Claude, cheaply
  prompted) reads the discussion after each response and decides who should
  speak next, based on which questions still have `[needs more evidence]` and
  who has the relevant expertise.
- **Option D — AutoGen wrapper:** Wrap each CLI agent as an AutoGen
  `ConversableAgent` with a custom reply function that shells out to the CLI.
  Use AutoGen's `SelectorGroupChat` for speaker selection and termination.

Which option is most appropriate for this use case, and why? Consider: failure
modes, token overhead, debuggability, and how well each matches the satisfaction
protocol termination signal.

### Q3 — Termination Detection (blocking)

Given a discussion file where each agent should write `[satisfied]`,
`[satisfied-conditional: <condition>]`, or `[needs more evidence: <what>]`,
how does the orchestrator reliably detect the end state?

- What parsing approach is robust against agents that forget the marker, use
  slightly different formatting, or produce malformed output?
- Should the IC agent make the satisfaction determination (more robust, costs a
  call), or should it be a regex/AST parse (cheaper, more brittle)?
- What is the correct behaviour when an agent writes `[satisfied-conditional]`
  — does the orchestrator close, continue, or escalate to the human?
- What is the fallback when max rounds is reached without consensus?

### Q4 — Implementation Form (design input, not blocking)

What should the orchestrator be implemented in?

- A shell script (minimal deps, easy to inspect, harder to make robust)
- Python (good subprocess handling, easy to add LLM SDK calls for the selector)
- **Elixir / OTP** (owner preference — see section above; BEAM supervision,
  `Task.async_stream` for parallel invocation, `System.cmd/3` for CLI
  subprocess, natural message-passing for turn protocol)
- A Nix flake that packages any of the above (for reproducible, pinned deps)
- Something else from the prior art survey that already solves enough of this

Consider: the developer already has Nix, git, and the CLI agents, and has a
stated preference for Elixir. What is the minimum viable implementation that
actually runs and makes good use of the BEAM's properties — or, if another
platform is clearly better, why?

### Q5 — Shared State Medium: Filesystem Blackboard vs GitHub Issues (blocking)

The current design uses a markdown file (`ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md`) committed to
git as the shared state. This was inherited from the prior blackboard model,
where it worked well for human-paced discussions. For automated turn-taking it
has significant weaknesses:

**Problems with file + git commit:**
- Two agents writing simultaneously → merge conflict; requires pull/push
  discipline that is hard to enforce across separately-invoked CLI processes
- One growing file creates context window pressure over many rounds
- No per-question threading; the orchestrator must parse the whole file to
  find each question's state
- Termination detection requires regex over unstructured prose

**GitHub Issues as an alternative shared state:**
- One issue per question (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Agents post comments via `gh issue comment <n> --body "..."` — no git
  operations, no merge conflicts, parallel writes are safe
- Orchestrator reads state with `gh issue view <n> --comments --json`
- Labels (`satisfied`, `needs-more-evidence`, `satisfied-conditional`) track
  per-question state without markdown parsing
- Closing an issue is the natural termination signal for that question
- GitHub's own notification infrastructure becomes available
- `BRIEF.md` and `DECISION.md` stay as files; `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` becomes
  an index pointing to the issues

**Trade-offs to consider:**
- GitHub Issues require a `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `gh` CLI installed; adds an
  external dependency the filesystem approach avoids
- Issue comment threads lack the rich signed-position format of the current
  markdown structure; formatting conventions would need porting
- A hybrid is possible: issues for active discussion rounds, files for
  BRIEF/DECISION/archive

**The question:** Should the orchestrator use the filesystem blackboard, GitHub
Issues, a hybrid, or something else as its shared state medium? This choice
directly affects Q1 (what agents need to do after generating output), Q2 (how
turn-taking is signalled), and Q3 (how termination is detected). Address this
before or alongside those questions.

## How To Contribute a Position

Write a signed position to `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` in this directory. Address
one or more questions above with primary evidence (CLI help output, source code
references, or live test results). Follow the format in the discussion file.

Mark each question you address as `[satisfied]`, `[satisfied-conditional: X]`,
or `[needs more evidence: X]` at the end of your position.

**The IC will not close any question until all contributing agents have marked
it satisfied.** The discussion continues until all agents are satisfied.

When Q1–Q3 have consensus positions, the IC will write `DECISION.md` and
implementation begins.

### Q15 — How does our consensus protocol compare to the YC interview protocol?

**Context:** Y Combinator's partner interviews assess founders using a
structured, time-bounded process: roughly 10 minutes, multiple partners
present, rapid-fire questions that probe conviction, clarity, and resilience
under pressure. After the interview, partners converge on a binary decision
(fund / pass) through discussion. The protocol is adversarial by design —
challenge the founder, see if they hold or fold.

Our satisfaction protocol is structurally different:
- Collaborative rather than adversarial
- Graduated output (`[satisfied]` / `[satisfied-conditional]` / `[needs more
  evidence]`) rather than binary
- Round-bounded rather than time-bounded
- IC synthesises rather than founder defends
- Convergence is explicit (all markers satisfied) rather than implicit
  (partners agree)

**Questions for agents:**

1. What does the YC protocol optimise for that ours does not — and vice versa?
2. Are there elements of the YC adversarial model we should borrow? For
   example: a designated "devil's advocate" agent whose role is to challenge
   rather than build consensus?
3. YC uses a binary outcome because they need a decision. We use graduated
   markers because we need shared understanding. Is there a case where a
   roundtable should produce a binary outcome instead?
4. YC partners share a rubric but apply independent judgment. Our agents share
   the satisfied protocol but also apply it independently. Where does that
   analogy break down?
